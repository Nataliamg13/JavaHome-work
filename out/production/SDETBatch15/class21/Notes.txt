Super keyword:
Is used to refer to the parent class members like fields methods and constructors.
When we should use Super or "this " keyword:
when ever same name field or method exists inside the parent and child class, we can use super
keyword to explicitily refer to parent class variables methods or constructor.
Notes:
    By defalt java prefers local variables then instance variables from the same class
    after that the instance variables or methods from the parent class.
    Super works when we are inside a child class only.
    Method overloading :
    Definition=>method overloading happens when same name method exists in a class with
    different parameters.
    We can overload methods in 3 different ways.
    1)By changing the numbers of parameters,
    2) By changing the data types.
    3) By changing the sequence of parameters.
    Why we should overload a method or constracter?
    --Clean code and flexibility to the end user.
