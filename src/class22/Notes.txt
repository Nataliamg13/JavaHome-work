MethodOverloading:
It's a mechanism in java that allows us to have the same method name with different parameters.
Parameters can be different in number , type, sequence.
Why we should overload a method?
    1)Method overloading allows us to reuse same method name again and again that we don't have to come up with different
  methods name if we are doing the same thing again and again.
    2) It allows us to write clean code.
How to overload a method:
    wWe can overload a method by redefining it with different parameters.

    Method Overriding:
    It's a mechanism in java that allows a subclass or child to provide a specific implementation of a method.

2)If something can't be inherited we can't override it.For example private methods and constructions.
