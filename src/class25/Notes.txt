Abstraction:
   Allows us to simplify code by hiding implementation details and only showing the functionality to the user.
   In Java we can achieve this in 2 ways:
   1) Abstract classes.
   2)Interface

   Interface:
         is very similar to a abstract class.We can have private methods static methods default methods
         abstract method we can static  in an interface.We can't have instance fields in
          an interface and because we dont have instance fields we also cant have a constraction in an interface.

     Why we should learn about interface:
""""Abstract classes should be used primarily for objects that are closely related, whereas interfaces are best
suited for providing a common functionality to unrelated classes."""""

When we should use interface:
   When objects are closely related to each other and there is a "IS A" relationship between classes then
    we should go with abstract classes if we want to use abstraction.

    If Objects are not related to each other ,then we should implement abstraction with the help of" INTERFACE"
